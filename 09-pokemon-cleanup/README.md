### Clean it up

Let's clean up the code!
DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself

***

### Objectives

- Refactor the code to minimize repitition and improve readability. Clean code makes for fewer bugs.
- Refactor should happen LAST. 'First make it work, then make it pretty.'
- We will continually check to make sure our application still works as we refactor so we don't 'break it all to hell'

### Using JSON Server

- You should have already installed JSON Server by running the following command in the terminal: `npm install -g json-server`
- To start the JSON server, run `json-server --w db.json --r routes.json` while in the directory that contains the `db.json` file i.e. `SCF-SENG.../08-js-fetch-post`
- For this project, we will start with the following endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/characters`
